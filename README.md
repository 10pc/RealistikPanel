# RealistikPanel!
The modern admin panel for osu! private servers! This is designed to be a fully fledged Ripple Admin Panel when in its finished state.

It uses libraries such as Flask for web and is designed to interface with the Ripple stack (mainly with SQL and Redis).

# About

You may notice that some of this code (especially the early one) is not too great. This is because this is a learning trip for me.
I am using a lot of libraries and concepts that are new to me and it's the first time I'm doing them.
This may be reflected in the quality of the code. I will try to fix up or replace some of the old code when I'm satisfied with the feature set.

**THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN ITS EARLY STAGES. NOT EVERY PLANNED FEATURE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AND SOME COMMITS MAY BE BUGGY OR BROKEN.**
